        "\n",
        "Using a dataset of thousands of chess games, with data including opening move, length of book-approved opening sequence, elo rating of both players, game outcome, and time of the game, we predict the number of turns in a game of chess. Primarily, we will conduct the relevant data wrangling, build a model that will use the previously stated factors to predict game turns using a linear regression model, and then perform some tweaking of the model to improve its outcome. We will be enlisting a number of linear regression algorithms to search for the best method of prediction, including Random Forest regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent regression, Gradient Boosting regression, Bayesian Ridge regression, among many others. In doing this, we plan to supplement the extensive research on game outcome prediction - however, this would serve the purposes of time planning in a tournament or livestream environment, rather than the purpose of education."

        "\n",
        "Chess has debatably been the single most popular test subject for the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The game famously put AI on the map with IBM's \"Deep Blue\" program that managed to best the world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997. And as ML techniques have become more sophisticated and chess has gotten digitized, ML engineers of course keep returning to chess to create more algorithms for the game.\n",

        "Lichess is one of the most popular online chess websites and our dataset is from games played on it. The most common metric used in chess to rate players is the ELO rating which is based on a relative scale\n",
        "<a name=\"elo\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#cite_note-1). Lichess uses a slightly modified version of the official FIDE ELO system wherein the median rating is 1500 so any new account starts off at that rating<a name=\"elo2\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#cite_note-2). \n",
        "An opening in a chess game is defined as the phase where the initial moves are made. Usually the position on the board after the first 2-4 moves has been studied extensively and is considered theory. Each such opening has a name which is one of the features of the dataset. The data also features the number of turns the opening lasted. Exactly defining where the opening phase ends is a matter of subjectivity but the way the dataset quantifies this is by considering the first \"out of theory\" or \"non-book\" move as the end of the opening. \n",
        "Modern chess is almost always played with time constraints. A 10+3 time constraint implies that each player gets 10 minutes to make all their moves and at the end of each turn they get an additional 3 seconds. Running out of time is one of 4 ways to end a chess game along with Resignation(which is where the losing player forfeits the game), Checkmate(duh), and a Draw.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most of the prior AI work in the chess field is targetted towards building better engines that can find the best move in a position and also quantifiably analyzing the position on the board<a name=\"3\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#cite_note-3). There are some prediction models for the outcome of a game<a name=\"4\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#cite_note-4)  but not much well-documented research into the number of turns a game lasts."

        "The dataset that we plan on using can be obtained [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess). This Chess dataset features over 20,000 different chess games collected from the website [lichess.org](https://lichess.org/). There are a total of 16 different variables in the dataset, with most being relevant to understanding a game of chess and its outcome. Each observation in the dataset is a single game of chess, containing the outcome along with important information such as what type of opening was performed, the length of the match, and the number of turns just to name a few. As of right now, we do not envision any special handling or cleaning that will be needed for the dataset. This is obviously subject to change once we start working with the set, but for right now we are planning on doing standard cleaning (such as dropping non-significant columns)."

        "Given the continuous nature of the predicted value, our project will be focusing on different variants of regression. We are going to vectorize the opening data by one-hot encoding the strings of the 30 most common openings. Using those, and the numerical data of the other features, we will perform regression on the data after we have one hot encoded the openings. There doesn't appear to be a \"standard\" model we can directly reference our model with - many have tackled predicting the outcomes of chess games or what the most optimal moves are for given situations, but the inputs and outputs of our prediction goal are unique to this project.\n",

While our testing has proved that predicting game length from categorical factors like rating and opening is indeed a regressable relationship, even our most accurate method using Gradient Boosting leaves something to be desired with a MSE of 958.43. That being said, determining a single best algorithm for the task is a huge step in the right direction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course, chess is a game where people have to make constant choices, going well beyond which opening they use. For that reason, a high error for predicting the length of a game is expected, except for maybe the highest level of play where players more frequently make moves proven to be optimal given the situation their respective openings have led them to. With that in mind, an MSE of 958, predicting across all ratings and therefore skill levels, is better than anticipated - additional testing is definitely in order here.\n",
        "\n",
        "In subsequent studies we would hopefully have the computational power to search through even more Gradient Boosting hyperparameters, for starters. Additionally, some of the predicting variables may not have been as arbitrary as we'd initially thought, so gradual reinclusion may or may not help in minimizing prediction error. In its current state, our algorithm cannot assist in the problem of tournament schedule or livestream planning as we'd set out to do."
