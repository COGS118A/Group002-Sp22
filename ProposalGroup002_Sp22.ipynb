        "**Using a dataset of thousands of chess games, with data including opening move, length of book-approved opening sequence, elo rating of both players, game outcome, and time of the game, we hope to predict the number of turns in a game of chess. Primarily, we will conduct the relevant data wrangling, build a model that will use the previously stated factors to predict game turns using a linear regression model, and then perform some tweaking of the model to improve its outcome. Since we are doing a prediction of continous numbers and not categories, we are going to measure success by doing a training set, test set, and validation set, and scoring our model by how far away it is. Finally, we can create games of our own, and test our algorithm on data that we create with our own chess games.** "

And as ML techniques have become more sophisticated and chess has gotten digitized, ML engineers of course keep returning to chess to create more algorithms for the game."

Given the continuous nature of the predicted value, our project will be using a linear regression model and a KNN approach. We are going to vectorize the opening data by one-hot encoding the strings of the 30 most common openings. Using those, and the numerical data of the other features, we will perform lineear regression for the continuous data, and then categorize the continuous data into increments of 5 to use KNN to see which performs better. We will use $R^{2}$ error to see how well our model performs for the linear regression "

There are a total of 16 different variables in the dataset, with most being relevant to understanding a game of chess and its outcome. Each observation in the dataset is a single game of chess, containing the outcome along with important information such as what type of opening was performed, the length of the match, and the number of turns just to name a few. As of right now, we do not envision any special handling or cleaning that will be needed for the dataset. This is obviously subject to change once we start working with the set, but for right now we are planning on doing standard cleaning (such as dropping non-significant columns)."
